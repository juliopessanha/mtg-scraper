# Magic: The Gathering Scraper

MTG-Scraper gathers all Magic: The Gathering card data from https://scryfall.com and saves it locally in json and xlsx format.

It's a part of a work-in-progress Twitter bot.

## How to Extract the Data:

All you need to do is run the run.py script as "python3 run.py". The code will extract all the data (which takes several minutes) and save it in a cards.json and mtg_data.xlsx files.
